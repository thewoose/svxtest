= Thirdparty contributions =

This directory contain some contributions that is not yet an official part of
the SvxLink project. The reason for that can be that parts are missing, like
documentation or sound clips, or that the code have not yet been thoroughly
reviewed.

== Building ==
To emphasize that this may be unstable code, no contributions are built or
installed by default. They must be explicitly enabled during the build process.
This is done using command line arguments for the cmake executable during the
normal build process. The general pattern look like this:

  cmake -DWITH_CONTRIB_name_of_contrib=ON ..

Example:

  cmake -DWITH_CONTRIB_MODULE_REMOTE_RELAY=ON ..

== Package Maintainers ==
If building binary packages of SvxLink, it should be made clear to the user
that this is unofficial code. The preferred way is to provide contributions in
separate packages.
