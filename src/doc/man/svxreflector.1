.SH NAME
.
svxreflector \- The SvxLink conference server audio reflector
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.
.BI "svxreflector [--help] [--daemon] [--logfile=" "log file" "] [--config=" "configuration file" "] [--pidfile=" "pid file" "] [--runasuser=" "user name" ]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
The
.B SvxReflector
server is used to interconnect multiple SvxLink nodes into one network. Traffic
is switched using talk groups in the SvxReflector server so that all audio sent
to the reflector from one node is retransmitted on all other nodes that have
selected the same talk group. Only one talker is allowed at a time on each talk
group so if another node starts sending audio when another one is already
active, the second node will not interrupt the first talker.
.P
A TCP/IP connection is used for the control messages and the audio is
transported via UDP. Make sure to open up the configured TCP and UDP ports in
your firewall for incoming traffic on the server. By default the port number is
set to 5300 for both TCP and UDP. The clients do not have to open any ports in
their firewall. Each node must have a unique user ID, typically the callsign.
It is not allowed for a client, using the same user ID, to connect more than
one time to the server. The connections are password protected.
.P
On the SvxLink node side, a ReflectorLogic should be used to connect to the
SvxReflector server. The connection to the SvxReflector from other logics in
that node can be activated and deactivated using standard logic linking. Read
more about how to set up a SvxLink node for use with the SvxReflector in the
.BR svxlink.conf (5)
manual page.
.P
The SvxReflector offer a QSY functionality which is used to switch all active
nodes to another talk group. This can be used to make a call on a broad talk
group, like a large region or the entire country, and when the called party
answers a QSY can be performed to a talk group where only the active nodes are
included.
